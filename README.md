# Heliocidaris_tx_plots
Code for generating developmental gene expression comparisons between Heliocidaris and other sea urchin species.  

This code builds on an R script originally developed by Jennifer Israel to analyze comparative developmental transcriptomes (Israel et al. 2016 PLoS Biology DOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.1002391) and later extended by Phillip Davidson for internal use in the Wray Lab. 

Objectives:
Rigorous orthology assessment: convert from SPU-based to orthogroup-based orthology (implemented in OrthoFinder).  
Flexible orthogroup comparisons: allow filtering for 1:1, 1:2, and 2:2 orthologues.
Clean code: replace deprecated functions, harmonize naming, add comments.
